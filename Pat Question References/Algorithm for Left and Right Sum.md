_To approach this question, we can use the benefit of indexing forwards and backwards_
1. Start
2. Input the number of items in the array
3. Input the number of items according to the array
4. Initialize empty arrays for the two sums, left and right
5. Initialize empty counts for left and right sum
6. Iterate through the array
7. Append the array's ith element to left sum and increment left sum by the same
8. Increment The right sum by the array's length-ith element and append it to right list
9. Now iterate through the two lists and find common element 
10. Print Common element
11. Print two lists
12. Stop
